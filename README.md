# Security Risk Management (FALL 2019)
Academic work from the course Security Risk Management and Assessment (CY 5200)

## HGA Case Study
A Case study illustrating how a hypothetical government agency (HGA) deals with computer security issues in its operating environment was given. The task at hand was to assess the threats to its computer security system and to determine the recommendations for mitigating those risks.
The following assessments were conducted:
- Performed a Qualitative security risk assessment for a Hypothetical Government Agency (HGA)
- Performed a Quantitative security risk assessment for a Hypothetical Government Agency (HGA)
- Applied Risk Prevention and Risk Response (Resilience) Strategies; added missing M-O-T controls, calculated the residual risk, and created a Risk Management Plan for HGA

## Real-World Company Assessment
Next, a Real-world company is selected. The name of the company is not mentioned here for obvious reasons. I have contacted a company representative and with their help, determined a list of critical assets with $ values, potential threats, potential vulnerabilities, potential risks, and current M-O-T (Management, Operational, and Technical) controls; Risks have been identified for the assets and the residual risks calculated.

List of recommended Prevention controls and policies are created to reduce vulnerability probabilities and thus mitigate the identified risks – Risk Prevention Strategy.

Also, list of recommended Hardening methods and policies are implemented to reduce asset risk impact and thus mitigate the identified risks and increase resilience  – Risk Response Strategy.

Lastly, a list of recommended Prevention and Response controls, methods and policies are provided.

Risk Management Implementation Plans for this company are created based on NIST recommended hardening methods and policies. The following plans were created:
1. Access Risk management Implementation plan
2. Network Risk management Implementation plan
3. Database Risk Management Implementation Plan
4. Application Risk Management Implementation Plan
5. Wireless Risk Management Implementation Plan

Finally, the class project paper is an amalgamation of HGA Case study and the assessment for the company I selected. Also, list of NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NCWF) Cybersecurity Tasks and Work Roles existing in the company are added here.
